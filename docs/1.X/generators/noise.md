# Noise Generator

The **Noise Generator** uses noise algorithms to generate natural-looking two-dimensional terrain. For each coordinate of the world size, and only if the noise's value at those coordinates is higher than a predetermined threshold, it places a tile. Using different noise algorithms, and changing the noise's parameters, you can generate a wide assortment of terrains.

## How does it work?

NoiseGenerator uses the widely used and very useful **noise texture**: with the different algorithms Godot gives you access to using FastNoiseLite, in addition to a lot of configuration, you can create different terrain shapes and make your very own type of terrain.

Additionally, Gaea's NoiseGenerator comes with a **Falloff Map**, taken from Sebastian Lague's [procedural landmass generation course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COmtTyLCd6I). This texture has higher values at its center which get lower as they get farther away from it. This then gets multiplied with the noise's value, creating an island shape.
