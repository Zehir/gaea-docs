Gaea is an **add-on for Godot 4.X**\*, designed to empower your project with advanced **procedural generation** capabilities.

*For 4.3, use v1.X . For 4.2, use v1.1.3 or lower. For 4.0-4.1, use v0.6.2 or lower.

> **NOTE:** Gaea 2.0 is currently in early development, and may not yet be optimized for larger, more complex projects. Stay tuned for ongoing improvements and enhancements!

### What's in a Name?

**Gaea**, in Greek mythology, is the personification of Earth - a nod towards the terrain and world generation capabilities this addon brings to your game development toolkit. Plus, we think it sounds pretty cool.

# Which version should I use?

If you need Gaea for your project _now_, use any 1.X versions. Otherwise, 2.0 is in beta and growing. It's not stable yet, but you can help by contributing or wait for a stable release!


# 🔧 Installation Steps

1. **Download the project files.**
2. Move the `gaea` folder into your `/addons` folder within your Godot project.
3. Enable the addon through the project settings, and let your world-building journey begin!
